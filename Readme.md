## Description

The Foods For Days application reduces the stress of figuring out "what's for dinner?" The user has access to cuisines from across the world to explore different recipes.  Once they sign up for an account, they can save any recipe to their own private profile.  Whenever they are stumped on what to cook, they can login again and display their own private cookbook with a list of the recipes that they have saved from across the world.  With an easy click of a button, they have access to the full recipe with ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it.  They can even email the recipe instructions to themselves right from the recipe card.

You never have to cook a boring meal again!

The application is fully responsive and intuitive to use.
